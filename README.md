Challenge 1 Portfolio Webpage


As an open and approachable person who loves to engage with others both in person and virtually, I find myself always drawn to anything to do with technology and computers. As a self starter who loves being part of a team as well, I bring discpline and rigour from my years serving the US Army. This, in addition to my numerous diplomas in digital art, technology, animation, and now coding, have helped me reach my present postion where I hope to develop websites, both large and small. Ease of transition, smooth and appealing visuals that help deliver a client's vision in a concise and timely manner are my goals. Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
